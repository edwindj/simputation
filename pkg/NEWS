version 0.2.1
- added support for elasticnet / lasso regression (using 'glmnet')
- renamed 'na.action' -> 'na_action' for consistency within simputation.
- default 'na_action' for 'impute_cart' is now 'na.rpart'.
- dependencies on larger packages (randomForest, glmnet) moved to 'suggests'.
- Fix in 'impute_rf': needed workaround for bug in randomForest 4.6.12 
  (formulas like Y ~ . - X not handled correctly by predict.randomForest).
- bugfix in 'impute_pmm': argument 'predictor' was ignored.

version 0.2.0
- Added na.action option for model-based imputation (thanks to Soogeun Park)
- impute_rhd, impute_shd, and impute_knn now have option 'backend="VIM"'
- removed call to structure(NULL,*) to comply to changes in R-devel (thanks to Martin Maechler)

version 0.1.0
- initial release
