version 0.2.1
- added support for elasticnet / lasso regression (using 'glmnet')
- added support for missForest imputation (using 'missForest')
- impute_proxy now supports transformations in the rhs of formula.
- new functions 'simputation_capabilities' and 'simputation_suggests'
  detect which packages supporting imputation methods are available.
- renamed 'na.action' -> 'na_action' for consistency within simputation.
- default 'na_action' for 'impute_cart' is now 'na.rpart'
- dependencies on larger packages (randomForest, glmnet) moved to 'suggests'
- Fix in 'impute_rf': needed workaround for bug in randomForest 4.6.12 
  (formulas like Y ~ . - X not handled correctly by predict.randomForest)
- bugfix in 'impute_pmm': argument 'predictor' was ignored.
