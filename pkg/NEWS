version 0.2.2
- new functions 'impute' and 'impute_' use pre-fit models to impute datasets. (Thanks to Max Kuhn for suggesting this).
- new utility function 'foretell'. Replacement for 'predict' that always returns values of the predicted type.
- bugfix: ... arguments were not passed correctly for linear models.

version 0.2.1
- Added support for ridge/elasticnet/lasso regression (using 'glmnet')
- Added support for missForest imputation (using 'missForest')
- Added support for imputation using EM-estimated parameters (using 'norm')
- 'impute_proxy' now supports transformations in the rhs of formula.
- 'impute_median' gains 'type' argument to specify algorithm for median computation.
- New functions 'simputation_capabilities' and 'simputation_suggests'
  detect which packages supporting imputation methods are available.
- Renamed 'na.action' -> 'na_action' for consistency within simputation.
- Default 'na_action' for 'impute_cart' is now 'na.rpart'
- Default 'na_action' for 'impute_rf' is not 'na.roughfix'
- Complete overhaul of function documentation. Now set up systematically
  with synopsis of methodology where relevant.
- Dependencies on larger packages (randomForest, glmnet) moved to 'Suggests'
- Fix in 'impute_rf': needed workaround for bug in randomForest 4.6.12 
  (formulas like Y ~ . - X not handled correctly by predict.randomForest)
- Bugfix in 'impute_pmm': argument 'predictor' was ignored.
- Bugfix in 'impute_rhd': attributes of 'dat' were not always preserved.

version 0.2.0
- Added na.action option for model-based imputation (thanks to Soogeun Park)
- impute_rhd, impute_shd, and impute_knn now have option 'backend="VIM"'
- removed call to structure(NULL,*) to comply to changes in R-devel (thanks to Martin Maechler)

version 0.1.0
- initial release
